# Stakeholder management

Transparency, make your roadmap public. Be realistic about near and far future.

# Stakeholder management

Involve your end-users
- Demos, show end-users your things **early**.
- User Groups, listen to their needs.
- Workshops, let them get hands on.
- Chaos Engineering / Product tests, involve them in the early in the product development.

# Stakeholder management

Link top-down to your work, find a way to prioritize

- Objectives and Key Results (OKR) - but beware.
- Cost of Delay Devided by Duration (CD3) or similar

# Takeaways
What did we (hopefully) learn

* Take time considering what gaps you are bridging and whether your end-users agree
* Be clear on who handles the product management.
* Make sure to have a way to challenge your lines
